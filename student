Write a program to print the name of student by creating a Student class. If no name is passed while creating an object of Student
class, then the name should be "Unknown", otherwise the name should be equal to the String value passed while creating object of
Student class.
Hint: Read the name of student through keyboard from the user.

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Student
{
String name;
Student(String name)
{
this.name = name;
}
Student()
{
name = "Unknown";
}

}

class Que1_A3
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
String name=sc.next();
Student s1 = new Student(name);
Student s2 = new Student();
System.out.println(s1.name);
System.out.println(s2.name);
}
}
